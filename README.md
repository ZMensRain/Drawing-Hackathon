# Hackathon drawing

## Pain…t

Pain…t is a drawing app that allows the user to choose from a multitude of pen and background colors in order to create incredible artworks…at a catch, the program as all programs does not function the way it could and will periodically change the users brush size as well as the pen colour that the user has chosen. As per the name suggests this is no ordinary drawing app thanks to these features.

This project was created by 3 individuals, ZMR, enderneale and Eclypsis as credited on the project.
